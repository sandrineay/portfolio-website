        <p>My original background is business. I started my career 7 years ago as an analyst in a VC fund. Throughout all my experiences in the startup world, I came to work with a lot of talented software engineers and developers.</p>
        <p>Meeting and working with these technical teams made me want to become a developer myself! I decided to “jump on the other side” and to learn how to code in 2017, and have now been happily coding for 1.5 years! 👩‍💻</p>
